# RangeGuard Project Status

Last Updated: 2026-05-31 (Session 9 — checkpoint / seedBuffer)

## How to use this file

- The **Roadmap** is the single source of truth for progress — one checkbox per item.
- **Now** holds the active target plus its granular impl/unit/fuzz/invariant sub-status.
  Only the in-progress item is tracked at that granularity here.
- **Completed** items collapse to one line and link to a `docs/` session doc for detail,
  instead of repeating per-item checklists.
- Each session: update **Now**, tick the **Roadmap**, refresh the date. Do not duplicate
  status across sections.
- Per-function build order (mandatory, per CLAUDE.md): implement -> unit -> fuzz ->
  invariant; correctness before gas.

---

## Now

- **Active target:** Reactive Network contract — `onlyReactive(poolId)` guard (on
  `_reactiveSet[poolId]`), `emitOutOfRange` / `emitBackInRange`, subscribe to `TickUpdated`, and
  drive `checkpoint()` on the periodic heartbeat + range-crossing triggers. Reactive contracts must
  never mutate accounting state.
- **Just completed:** `checkpoint()` + `seedBuffer()`. `checkpoint(poolId, positionKey)` is
  permissionless and accrual-ONLY (no IL/payout/transfer): guards `_poolInitialized` →
  `PositionNotActive` → `block.timestamp - lastAccrualTime < minCheckpointInterval`
  (`CheckpointTooSoon`), reads the live tick via the new private `_getCurrentTick(poolId)`, calls
  `_accrue`, emits `Checkpointed`. `seedBuffer(key, amount)` is admin-only (`config.admin`) REAL
  token1 custody: guards `_poolInitialized` → `CallerNotAdmin` → `ZeroAmount`, pulls via
  `IERC20Minimal.transferFrom` (CurrencyLibrary has no `transferFrom`), credits
  `bufferBalanceStable` ONLY (not `totalSkimmedStable`), emits `BufferSeeded`.
- **Locked decisions resolved this session:**
  - **R1: `_getCurrentTick`** — the spec referenced it but it was never implemented (callbacks
    inline `getSlot0`); added as a private helper for `checkpoint()`; existing inline reads kept.
  - **R2: token pull** — `IERC20Minimal.transferFrom` with a checked bool (revert on false); admin
    must `approve(hook, amount)` first.
  - **R3: `minCheckpointInterval == 0`** allowed (no staging bound); same-block re-checkpoints are
    harmless (`dt == 0` → zero delta). Staging validation NOT touched.
  - **R4: seed credits `bufferBalanceStable` only** — `totalSkimmedStable` is fee accounting;
    `getBufferHealth` reflecting seeds in the balance is desired.
  - **R5: native token1** can't be seeded (no `transferFrom`); out of MVP scope, documented only.
- **R2 carry-in (from session 8) RESOLVED:** `seedBuffer()` provides the real token1 custody the
  payout transfer depends on. The new `SeedBufferInvariant` and the new integration test use real
  seeded custody instead of minting token1 directly to the hook.
- **Carry-ins:**
  - Position owner attribution: payout recipient is the v4 `sender` (owner=sender MVP).
  - **Doc drift (deferred):** `invariant-mapping.md` + `state-machine.md` still reference
    `pendingPayout` / `PendingSettlement`; spec.md §6–§8 narrate the old settlement flow and the
    unimplemented `_getCurrentTick`. Fix in the standalone doc pass alongside the Reactive work.
- **Tests:** 210 passing, 0 failing.

## Completed

- **checkpoint() / seedBuffer()** — Phase-2 externals. `checkpoint()` is the permissionless,
  accrual-only Reactive entry point (`_poolInitialized` → active → `minCheckpointInterval`
  (`CheckpointTooSoon`) → `_accrue` via new private `_getCurrentTick` → `Checkpointed`).
  `seedBuffer()` is admin-only REAL token1 custody (`IERC20Minimal.transferFrom`; credits
  `bufferBalanceStable` only), resolving the session-8 R2 carry-in. Full test suite: 16 unit + 4
  fuzz + 8 invariant (CheckpointInvariant + SeedBufferInvariant + handlers, 50k calls × 0 reverts) +
  1 integration (real seedBuffer custody → checkpoint → settle). (+29 tests → 210 total)
  -> docs/session-9-checkpoint-seedBuffer-complete.md
- **beforeRemoveLiquidity() / afterRemoveLiquidity()** — withdrawal/settlement callbacks.
  `beforeRemoveLiquidity` (`view`) validates only: active position + full-withdrawal gate
  (`removed == pos.liquidity`). `afterRemoveLiquidity` runs all settlement from the realized
  removal `BalanceDelta`: minHold hard gate (`IneligibleClaim` + clear), final `_accrue()`
  (exit tick via `getSlot0`), `_computeIL()` on the fees-included delta, `_computePayout()`
  three-cap, strict-CEI payout (clear + buffer update before a real token1 transfer),
  `ClaimSettled` / `PartialPayout` / `NoClaim`. PositionState dropped `pendingPayout`, added
  `uint128 liquidity`; re-add now reverts `PositionAlreadyRegistered`. Full test suite: 14 unit
  - 2 fuzz + 3 invariant (SettlementExecution + handler) + 1 integration (real add→swap→warp→
    remove→ClaimSettled, custody/buffer/paidOut reconciled). (+20 tests → 181 total)
    -> docs/session-8-remove-liquidity-complete.md
- **beforeSwap() / afterSwap()** — swap-path callbacks. `beforeSwap` (`view`) returns the derived
  dynamic fee `(baseLpFeeBps + bufferBps) | OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG` + `ZERO_DELTA`, reads `poolConfig`
  only. `afterSwap` books the notional buffer credit (`|delta.amount1()| * bufferBps / FEE_DENOM`,
  FEE_DENOM = 1e6), increments `bufferBalanceStable` + `totalSkimmedStable`, emits `BufferFunded`
  (skipped on zero) + `TickUpdated` (every swap); no accrual, no position iteration. Added
  `FEE_DENOM` constant + two events; reused `_absToUint128`. Full test suite: 13 unit + 3 fuzz +
  3 invariant (BufferFundingInvariant + handler) + 2 integration (real swap + differential
  fee-override proof). (+21 tests → 161 total)
  -> docs/session-7-beforeSwap-afterSwap-complete.md
- **afterAddLiquidity()** — position registration + `dt=0` accrual baseline. Lifecycle guard
  (`_poolInitialized`), `owner=sender` key (MVP), re-add skip (immutable snapshot), principal =
  `delta - feesAccrued`, live entry tick via `getSlot0`, notional via shared `_priceFromTick`,
  `PositionRegistered` event, `_positionKey`/`_emitPositionRegistered`/`_absToUint128` helpers.
  Full test suite: 10 unit + 3 fuzz + 3 invariant (PositionLifecycleInvariant + handler) +
  1 integration (real PoolManager + router, live non-zero tick). (+17 tests → 140 total)
  -> docs/session-6-afterAddLiquidity-complete.md
- **Pool setup (three-phase)** — stagePoolConfig() + \_beforeInitialize() commit +
  setReactiveContract(); owner immutable (explicit ctor arg) + onlyOwner, hard-bound
  constants, PendingPoolSetup struct, setup mappings, 3 events, 16 errors. Full test
  suite: 32 unit + 3 fuzz (StagePoolConfigFuzz) + 6 invariant (PoolSetupInvariant +
  handler) + 4 integration (real PoolManager.initialize round-trip). Deploy script and
  harness updated for the owner ctor param. (+45 tests → 123 total)
  -> docs/session-5-pool-setup-complete.md
- **\_accrue()** — engine + shared pure helper \_accrueEarned(), supporting state
  (PoolConfig/PoolState/PositionState, mappings, AccrualUpdated), full test suite.
  -> docs/session-2-accrue-complete.md, docs/session1-accrue-decisions.md
- **\_computeIL()** — IL primitive + shared pure \_priceFromTick() helper (raw-ratio,
  decimal-agnostic; resolves Risk 6); full test suite (14 unit + 8 fuzz + 3 invariant).
  -> docs/session-3-computeIL-complete.md
- **\_computePayout()** — three-cap logic + LimitingFactor enum; pure \_computePayoutAmount()
  core + storage-reading wrapper; added BPS_DENOM, LimitingFactor enum, poolState mapping;
  full test suite (15 unit + 4 fuzz + 2 settlement invariants).
  -> docs/session-4-computePayout-complete.md
- **Scaffold & infra** — hook skeleton, getHookPermissions(), deploy scripts
  (DeployRangeGuardHook.s.sol, HelperConfig.s.sol), BaseRangeGuardTest, RangeGuardHookHarness,
  DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG enforcement, documentation system.
- **CI / process** — GitHub Actions (fmt + build + test, Foundry pinned 1.3.5); deploy flow
  runs without PRIVATE_KEY (envOr fallback); main protected (PR + green CI required).

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Accounting Primitives

- [x] \_accrue() (impl + unit + fuzz + invariant)
- [x] \_computeIL() (impl + unit + fuzz + invariant; shared \_priceFromTick helper)
- [x] \_computePayout() (impl + unit + fuzz + invariant; three-cap logic + LimitingFactor)

### Phase 2: Hook Callbacks

Pool setup + afterAddLiquidity wired; remaining callbacks are selector-returning skeletons.

- [x] Pool setup: stagePoolConfig() + \_beforeInitialize() commit + setReactiveContract()
      (three-phase pool bring-up; replaces original "beforeInitialize config decode" design;
      see docs/spec-amendment-beforeInitialize-config-split.md)
- [x] afterAddLiquidity() (register position, baseline \_accrue(); +17 tests, live-tick integration)
- [x] beforeSwap() (return derived dynamic fee + OVERRIDE flag; view, no state touched)
- [x] afterSwap() (notional buffer funding + TickUpdated; no accrual, no iteration; +21 tests)
- [x] beforeRemoveLiquidity() (validation only: active + full-withdrawal gate; +6 unit tests)
- [x] afterRemoveLiquidity() (v4-native settlement: minHold gate -> final \_accrue -> \_computeIL ->
      \_computePayout -> strict-CEI payout; ClaimSettled/PartialPayout/NoClaim; +14 tests)
- [x] checkpoint() (permissionless accrual-only Reactive entry point; \_poolInitialized/active/
      minCheckpointInterval gates, \_getCurrentTick + \_accrue, Checkpointed; +19 tests)
- [x] seedBuffer() (admin-only real token1 custody via IERC20Minimal.transferFrom; credits
      bufferBalanceStable only; BufferSeeded; resolves R2 real-custody carry-in; +10 tests)

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

- [x] Full LP lifecycle (CheckpointAndSeed: add→swap→seed→checkpoint→remove→settle, reconciled)
- [ ] Coverage accrual lifecycle (only single in-range checkpoint + final accrual covered;
      TODO: out-of-range pause / back-in-range resume / multi-checkpoint history — the in→out→in
      arc, partly gated on the Reactive contract's PositionOutOfRange/BackInRange emits)
- [x] Buffer funding lifecycle (Swap: notional skim from real swaps; CheckpointAndSeed: real seed custody)
- [x] Settlement lifecycle (RemoveLiquidity + CheckpointAndSeed: final accrue→IL→payout→transfer→cleanup)

Note: coverage is distributed across per-session integration files rather
than a single dedicated Phase 3 suite. A comprehensive single-test lifecycle
covering all callbacks end-to-end will come with the demo script.

### Phase 3B: Protocol Completion

- [ ] Reactive contract

      - onlyReactive(poolId) guard (on _reactiveSet[poolId])
      - emitOutOfRange() / emitBackInRange() (access-controlled)
      - TickUpdated subscription for range-crossing detection
      - checkpoint() heartbeat driver (periodic + range-crossing triggers)
      - Reactive contracts must never mutate accounting state

- [ ] Frontend dashboard (coverage report rendered from on-chain events)
- [ ] Demo script (RangeGuardDemo.s.sol with vm.warp, full 45-day lifecycle)

### Phase 4: Protocol Invariants (cross-cutting)

- [x] Accounting invariants (coverage + buffer + checkpoint: CoverageAccounting/Checkpoint/
      BufferFunding/SeedBuffer — earned never decreases/exceeds ceiling, inactive never accrues,
      clock monotonic, buffer never negative, snapshots immutable, maxPayoutPctOfBuffer<=BPS_DENOM)
- [ ] Lifecycle invariants (transitions proven in separate per-action campaigns
      (PositionLifecycle/Checkpoint/SettlementExecution); TODO: one combined stateful
      add→checkpoint→remove campaign on shared keys)
- [x] Settlement invariants (SettlementInvariant + SettlementExecutionInvariant: IL_raw never
      negative/bounded, payout <= every cap, buffer conserved (buffer+paidOut==seed), real custody==
      ledger, LimitingFactor matches binding cap)
- [ ] Authorization invariants (blocked on Reactive phase: onlyReactive/emitOutOfRange/emitBackInRange
      not built yet; access checks are unit-tested (owner/admin/initializer) + \_reactiveSet monotonic
      in PoolSetupInvariant, but no dedicated authorization-invariant suite and no "reactive never
      mutates accounting" coverage until the Reactive contract exists)

### Phase 5: Deployment Readiness on Anvil

- [ ] Anvil deployment
- [ ] Security review

### Phase 6: Deployment Readiness on Sepolia

- [ ] Sepolia deployment
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Mainnet readiness review
